In other words, the same value for all the rows of the dataset. These features provide no information that allows a machine learning model to discriminate or predict a target.\n","\n","Identifying and removing constant features is an easy first step towards feature selection and more easily interpretable machine learning models.\n","To identify constant features, we can use the VarianceThreshold from Scikit-learn, or we can code it ourselves. If using the VarianceThreshold, all our variables need to be numerical. If we do it manually however, we can apply the code to both numerical and categorical variables.\n","\n","3 snippets of code: 1 where I use the VarianceThreshold and 2 manually coded
