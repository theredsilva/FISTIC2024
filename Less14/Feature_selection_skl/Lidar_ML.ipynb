Lidar stands for Light Detection And Ranging, similar to sonar and radar with sound and radio waves respectively. Lidar technology uses beams of light to sense the range to an object. This can be very useful to a robot as it can sense the distance to a target or obstacle, and create a local “map” of the world around it.\n","\n","There are a huge variety of lidar models on the market, employing a range of different technologies, at different price points. For now, we can boil this down into three categories"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-U8UG2CUetlE"},"source":["<img src= \"https://frenzy86.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/python/Lidar1.png\" width=600>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oez956lKetlG"},"source":["- 1D - Measures the distance to a single point. These are often used as “digital tape measures”. Alone, these have limited usefulness, e.g. for a UAV to detect height from the ground or a mobile robot to detect the distance to a wall directly in front.\n","\n","- 2D - The most common type of lidar, this measures many points in a scan plane. The simplest models are simply a 1D lidar attached to a motor with an encoder. These are often used on mobile robots to create a floor plan to navigate around. Models vary in frequency, range (maximum distance), resolution, and horizontal field-of-view. These are sometimes called “laser scanners”.\n","\n","- 3D - There are an increasing number of 3D lidars on the market, that utilise a variety of methods and technologies. Rather than a single 2D scan plane, these lidars see in three dimensions. Some models can be effectively treated as 3D cameras, returning an image with a distance measured to each pixel."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BLfh5E6SetlH"},"source":["<img src= \"https://frenzy86.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/python/Lidar2.png\" width=600>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sx-f2PjJetlI"},"source":["Each LaserScan message contains the data for a single sweep of the sensor, and is basically an array of floats representing each range measurement (in metres), along with some extra parameters to aid in understanding the data properly.\n","\n","The principle of LIDAR operation is pretty simple. A focused light beam is aimed at an object and a sensor looks for its reflection. If the beam is detected its intensity and angle (or phase) is measured. These values are then plugged into an equation run by a fast onboard computer to determine the reflecting objects position and characteristics.\n","By “sweeping” the beam and receiver array mechanically we can quickly build up a 3D “image’ of the surrounding area. This is often displayed in a “point cloud” to help us humans visualize what the LIDAR is “seeing”.\n","\n","Of course LIDAR is not the only method that can be used to sense external surroundings.
